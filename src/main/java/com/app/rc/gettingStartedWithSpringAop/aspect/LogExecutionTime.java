/**
 * <p>
 * This annotation will be called along with <tt>@Around</tt> annotation which will calculate the total execution time
 * of the method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <tt>@Target</tt> annotation tells us where our annotation will be applicable. Here we are using
 * ElementType.Method, which means it will only work on methods. If we tried to use the annotation anywhere else, then
 * our code would fail to compile. This behavior makes sense, as our annotation will be used for logging method
 * execution time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * And <tt>@Retention</tt> just states whether the annotation will be available to the JVM at runtime or not. By default
 * it is not, so Spring AOP would not be able to see the annotation. This is why itâ€™s been reconfigured.
